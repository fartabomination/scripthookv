Here you can easily find the most recent version of scripthookv so your mods
can become compatible once again!

# Releases

you can find the releases by going to the "Releases" tab or going to https://github.com/fartabomination/scripthookv/releases/tag/Releases


as I search everywhere for the versions so you dont have to. its possible that a new release can not be found for several days or even weeks.
